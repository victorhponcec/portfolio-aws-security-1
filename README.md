# Project: Securing a 3-tier application ///...in progress///
Author: Victor Ponce

## Overview

This project demonstrates a secure, production-ready AWS architecture built with Terraform.
The goal is to showcase my security engineering skills by integrating defense-in-depth controls across networking, identity, monitoring, and application layers.

The base solution consists of a 3-tier application (web, app, database) with strong security measures: private subnets, strict security groups, centralized logging, threat detection, edge and layer 7 protection,  automated compliance checks, among others, alligned with the AWS Well-Architected framework.
